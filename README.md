## Getting Started
 MyDoodles.js is a library that allows you to easily create a block that can change automatically with theme like random color, weather, calender+mood etc. It also contains some user interaction.


To get started, simply include MyDoodles.js file and the three png image for weathersICON in your file(you can also choose your own image as long as they are of "png" and corresponding name, then you can easily usethe function inside (see details in below).

An easy start would be create a constructor like using code "const bg = new BlockGenerator();"(substitute bgfor any variable name you like), and then make block by calling "bg.makeBlock", default value are provided for this function so this would be the minimum needed to start using the library.
