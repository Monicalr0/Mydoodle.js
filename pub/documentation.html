    <h1>MyDoodles.js</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>I.Getting Started</h2>
        <p> MyDoodles.js is a library that allows you to easily create a block that can change automatically with
            theme like random color, weather, calender+mood etc. It also contains some user interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, simply include MyDoodles.js file and the three png image for weathersICON in your file(you
            can also choose your own image as long as they are of "png" and corresponding name, then you can easily use
            the function inside (see details in below).
        </p>
        <p>
            An easy start would be create a constructor like using code "const bg = new BlockGenerator();"(substitute bg
            for any variable name you like), and then make block by calling "bg.makeBlock", default value are provided
            for this function so this would be the minimum needed to start using the library.
        </p>

        <h2>II. List of APIs</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>BlockGenerator(): The basic function for starting to use the library, will automatically create an
                array storing all block created using this block generator.
            </li>

            <li>
                makeBlock(theme, inputText, type, displayChoice, parentNode = ): The mandatory function that create an
                actual block to modify on, as the mandatory object for this library is a block. All other function are
                based on the call of this function. (Most of them need input of the block ID returned by this function.
                The return value is the id of the block created. Default is a block that has different background color
                upon refresh, with message "Input Here".

                <ul> Input parameter for this function:
                    <li>
                        theme: the theme for this block, default is "random" which generated random color. If selection
                        is enabled (by parameter displayChoice = 1), then user can change the theme later, and the library
                        will automatically call function updateView to update the view. selections are "random", "weather"
                        "mood-default"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        inputText: the input text the developer want to present inside the block, default will be "Input
                        Here"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        type: default is normal, means this is applied only to the block selected (except for mood the
                        background color for whole page by setting)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        displayChoice: default is 0. 0 standards for the theme is locked, 1 stands for the selection of
                        theme are offered to user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        parentNode: default is body. This is the parent node in html the developers want the block attached to.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                changeTheme(theme, blockID, inputText = null): This function can be used by developer to change the theme
                of some blocks by themselves. The meaning of parameter is the same as makeBlock function. The changed
                block will have the same size as before but with content change to corresponding theme.
            </li>

            <li>
                updateRadio(theme, radioID, blockID): This is a build-in function that generally developer won't need to
                use. When developer want to offer the user the selection of different theme, the radio of different types
                of that theme will also be offered to user (like different color for "random"). The updateRadio function
                is automatically called when user change to another theme, in order to change corresponding radio form to corresponding
                staff.(e.g. if theme are changed from the "random" to "weather", then radio are changed from "color" to
                "weathers")
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        radioID: the ID of corresponding radio form.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        blockID: the ID of the corresponding block changing theme.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>updateView(theme, blockID = "null", inputText = null, value=null): This is the core function of this library
            while this is also a function generally won't be called by developer but by library itself. When this function
                are called, it will update the block content based on input.
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        , will pass in the value the user wants the block to change to.
